# Patahuasi

PataHuasi, it's a place where we can find Inka tea, Muña tea, and some groceries(like Coke candy or Muña candy). Many people from different countries go there to take photos with their country flag.

Unfortunately I did this website yesterday, in my free time.
So I didn't fill up with many information.

I will fill this website with information about Chivay, Puno and other beautiful places here in Peru.
I hope you find interesting or helpful this website.

It's completely for free.
