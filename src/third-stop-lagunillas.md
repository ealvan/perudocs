It's a beautiful lake and according to MINCETUR, its length has 15.6 km and in width has 5.8km.
I find helpful [this website](https://consultasenlinea.mincetur.gob.pe/fichaInventario/index.aspx?cod_Ficha=2771) from the government.

The native species here are Ispi and Carachi. The scientific name for Carachi is [Orestias luteus](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orestias_luteus) and for Ispi is [Orestias Ispi](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orestias_ispi), the links are from Wikipedia.

Ispi eats zooplancton and Carachi has small, conical, strong teeth that can be used to break the shells of the molluscs and crustaceans it feeds on.
