# What is the purpose of this page?
The main purpose of this page is to collect information about Arequipa.
This website is for people who want to read something that is not so common to find on the internet.

# Why?
I want tourists like you to have something to read instead of just googling something.
I will try to be honest and impartial about the information I provide on this website.
I am not an expert, but I know people who are experts in this field.

I thought, why not put that information here on the internet?

I will fill this website with a lot of information about the Arequipa department (its towns and curiosities).

I will try to be impartial about the information, and if there is anything uncertain, I will make it clear by saying something like, "but there is no evidence I found."
