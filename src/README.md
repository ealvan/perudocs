**Introduction**

Hello! My name is Edsel, and I’ll be your guide on the journey from Chivay to Puno. I’m delighted you chose to explore Chivay, and I look forward to sharing this adventure with you.

Along the way, we’ll stop at three remarkable spots:

1. **Patapampa**  
   - At over 4,900 meters, Patapampa is quite windy and chilly. Be sure to wear a warm jacket or windbreaker.

2. **Patahuasi**  
   - After Patahuasi, it’s about a 1 hour and 40 minutes (aproximately) nonstop drive before we reach our next destination. So you can go to the bathroom or buy somegroceries like candies, cookies, drink Inka tea and so on.

3. **Las Lagunillas**  
   - The high-altitude lake is also windy and surrounded by rocky terrain. Keep your jacket on and watch your step.

Note: Please be mindful of our schedule—spending extra time at one stop may mean less time at others.

### Notes
 
There are bathrooms available at all our stops—Patapampa, Patahuasi, and Las Lagunillas Lake—but keep in mind that the time between each stop is over 40 minutes, so plan accordingly.
