# First place: Patapampa
Patapampa is the highest point during our trip. It is 4,900 meters above the sea level(m.a.s.l). If you have an altimeter, it could be around 4,800 m.a.s.l, always the measure are aproximately.

This place is also called the ViewPoint of Volcanoes, it offers a beautiful landscape where you can see the Misti, Ampato, Sabancaya volcanoes.

## Misti
This is the Misti volcanoe:

One curious thing: Inside the Misti volcanoe, exists a hidroelectric plant, the energy is made with the force of Chili river.
It is the only hydroelectric plant that operates inside a volcano in Peru. Some say itâ€™s the only one in the world, but I cannot confirm that.

If you want to see a video of Charcani V, I find helpful [this article](https://larepublica.pe/sociedad/2024/07/10/arequipa-el-corazon-del-volcan-misti-alberga-la-unica-central-hidroelectrica-del-mundo-que-funciona-dentro-de-un-volcan-lrsd-228830) from La Republica a journal here in Peru.


## Sabancaya
It's an active volcanoe, it is characterized by generating volcanic explosions, as well as emissions of ash and gases accompanied by the ejection of volcanic rock fragments.

I find helpful to see [this website](https://www.igp.gob.pe/servicios/centro-vulcanologico-nacional/edicion-especial/2023/sabancaya/) of IGP(Institute Geophysics of Peru) about Sabancaya, it's from the Peru government.
